## üß≠ Project Overview

CryptoCause is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows individuals to create and support charitable campaigns using cryptocurrency (ETH). What makes CryptoCause unique is its integration of **NFT-based donation certificates**, which act as cryptographic proof of donation. These NFTs are verifiable on-chain and can be used for real-world applications like CSR reporting, income tax deductions (e.g., under India‚Äôs 80G), or general acknowledgment of contributions to non-profit organizations.
The entire system ensures transparency, immutability, and trustless verification ‚Äî all without relying on any central authority.

## üåü Features
### üéØ 1. Campaign Creation and Management
Users can launch their own fundraising campaigns directly on the platform. Each campaign includes the following attributes:
- **Title and Description**: To provide donors with context about the cause.
- **Funding Goal**: The amount of ETH the campaign aims to raise.
- **Deadline**: A UNIX timestamp indicating the end of the campaign.
- **Campaign Image**: Uploaded and stored via **Cloudinary**, then referenced in the campaign metadata.
  
All campaign data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain using a **mapping structure** inside the smart contract, ensuring transparency and immutability.

The smart contract logic strictly enforces the requirement that deadlines must be in the future. This prevents invalid or misleading campaign setups.

---

### üí∞ 2. Transparent ETH Donations

Once campaigns are live, users can donate ETH through their MetaMask wallet or any Web3-compatible wallet.

**How it works:**
- Donors connect their wallet to the dApp.
- They choose a campaign and enter the amount of ETH to donate.
- The smart contract transfers ETH directly to the **campaign owner's wallet**.
  
The platform keeps an **on-chain record of:**
- The total amount raised per campaign
- A list of all donors and their individual contributions
- Timestamps of donations

This data is public and queryable, ensuring complete visibility into the donation process.

---

### üìñ 3. Public Campaign Explorer
All campaigns can be browsed and explored on the frontend. For each campaign, the following information is displayed:

- Campaign owner‚Äôs address
- Title, image, and detailed description
- Funding target vs. amount collected so far
- Deadline and current status (active or expired)
- List of all donors and the amount each contributed

This makes the donation process **transparent and verifiable** for both campaign creators and contributors.

---

## üéüÔ∏è Innovations: NFT-Based Donation Certification System
### üßæ 4. Automatic NFT Certificate Minting
Every successful donation triggers an automated NFT minting process through smart contract logic. This NFT is:

- **Minted using ERC-721 standards**
- Linked directly to the **donor‚Äôs wallet address**
- Represents a **blockchain-verified certificate of donation**

Each NFT is a permanent record of a donor‚Äôs contribution and is **non-fungible**, meaning each is unique and cannot be altered or replaced.

---

### üñºÔ∏è 5. Metadata-Driven On-Chain Proofs

Each NFT has a `tokenURI` that links to an IPFS or cloud-hosted JSON file. This metadata includes:

- Donor's wallet address
- Campaign title and description
- Amount donated in ETH
- The recipient NGO or cause name
- Ethereum transaction hash
- Issuer contract address

This metadata is **cryptographically verifiable** and can be inspected on-chain using a block explorer or via the platform‚Äôs frontend.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 6. Verifiable Blockchain-Based Donation Receipts

These NFTs are not just decorative ‚Äî they serve as **legal proof of donation** and can be used for:

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) documentation
- Income tax deductions under sections like **80G in India**
- Acknowledgements from NGOs
- Auditable compliance reporting for ESG

Since the proof resides on the blockchain, **no centralized verification** is needed. Anyone can inspect the token, view the metadata, and confirm authenticity using blockchain tools.

---

### üìé 7. NFT Certificate Verifier Page

The platform features a built-in certificate verifier page where:
- Anyone (auditor, government agency, NGO) can enter a **token ID**
- The system fetches the NFT metadata using the tokenURI
- It displays:
  - Owner address
  - Campaign details
  - Ethereum transaction hash
  - Contract issuer address

The frontend validates the NFT and shows a message like:  
`‚úÖ Verified by CryptoCause`  
if everything checks out.

---

### üñ®Ô∏è 8. HTML-to-PDF Certificate Export

For easier documentation and legal filing, users can export their donation NFT as a **printable PDF receipt**.

The PDF includes:

- Donor's name or wallet address
- Campaign or NGO name
- Donation amount in ETH
- Date and time (converted from timestamp)
- Ethereum transaction hash
- QR code linking to the NFT on a block explorer (optional)

This enables users to attach the document to government reports or CSR filings, bridging the gap between blockchain transparency and real-world utility.

## üî¨ Real-World Applications

### ‚úÖ Why CryptoCause is Not Just a Demo

CryptoCause was built with real-world problems in mind. The lack of transparency and fraud in charitable giving, especially in large-scale donation systems, often erodes trust. CryptoCause addresses this by making every transaction traceable, verifiable, and permanent.

**Use Cases:**
1. **CSR Reporting**: Corporates can publicly prove their charitable spending via NFTs.
2. **Tax Deduction**: Individuals can submit NFTs or downloadable PDFs as valid receipts under applicable tax laws.
3. **NGO Compliance**: NGOs can validate and report donations received through verifiable blockchain records.
4. **Government Audits**: No need to rely on third-party records. All data is cryptographically secure and visible on the chain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project ?
### 1. üõ† Frontend Setup (Using React):
Note: Make sure metamask is installed on the browser you are running your frontend before starting the subsequent steps.
1. **Terminal 1:**: Go to client directory
```
cd client
```

2. Install Node modules
```
npm install
```

3. Run the frontend
```
npm run dev
```

### 2. üõ† Smart Contract Setup (Using Hardhat)
1. Go to the smart contract directory
```
cd smartcontract
```
```
Note: 
1. For both the terminals go to the smartcontract directory and execute the below steps 
2. Also execute these in these order itself or else you will be in trouble
```

2. **Terminal 2:** Run the hardhat nodes
```
npx hardhat node
```

3. **Terminal 3:** compile the smart contract
```
npx hardhat compile
```
- After compiling copy paste the deployed contract address in the frontend .env
- Deploy the smart contract locally
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 3. üõ† Blockchain Visualizer 
1. Open one more tab on the browser where you are running your frontend, copy paste the below url
```
http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
- **Terminal 4:** is for the blockchain visualizer, go to the visualizer directory
```
cd Visualizer
```

- Run the following command
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
